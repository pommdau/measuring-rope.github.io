## What's app?

- MeasuringRope is a tool that allows you to measure the distance between two points on the screen.
- Since no part of the screen other than the pointer of the two points takes away from the mouse operation, you can measure the distance without disturbing the operation of other applications.
- In addition, the rope connecting the two points is elastic, providing an enjoyable operation experience. (Elasticity can also be eliminated from the settings.)
